# projects

A small unfinished introductory web development project created majority by Connie Chen, Brian Wang, and Tiffany Lee.

The project is unfinished as we were all occupied with responsiblities, hopefully one day we can revisit this project. 


Through this project, I was able to gain exposure to  HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.

My main responsibility was the contact form (form.php) and I was able to learn how to connect to databases through PHP.
